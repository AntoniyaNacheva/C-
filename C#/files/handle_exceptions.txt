Use Specific Exceptions: Catch more specific exceptions rather than general ones to handle errors more precisely.

Use Finally for Cleanup: Always use a finally block if you need to clean up resources (like files or database connections), regardless of whether an exception occurred.

Log Exceptions: Always log exception details for debugging and operational purposes.

Avoid Exception Handling for Control Flow: Use exceptions for exceptional cases, not regular control flows.
