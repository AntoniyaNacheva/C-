Characters that are Reserved in C#
In C#, certain characters are reserved for specific uses in the syntax of the language, and they play a critical role in the structure and operation of C# code. IMPORTANT: You don’t have to memorize these and neither already understand all of them. It’s just an overview for your convenience.

These reserved characters include:

Braces ({ }) - Used to define the scope or block of code, such as methods, loops, conditionals, and class definitions.

Parentheses (( )) - Used for method calls and declarations, controlling order of operations in expressions, and surrounding conditions in control structures like if, for, while, etc.

Square Brackets ([ ]) - Used for array type declarations and accessing array elements. Also used in attributes.

Semicolon (;) - Used to terminate statements.

Colon (:) - Used in conditional (ternary) operator expressions, in the context of case statements within a switch, and to denote a base class or interfaces in class declarations.

Comma (,) - Used to separate items in a list, such as parameters in method declarations, or variables in declarations.

Period (.) - Used to access members of a class or namespace, such as methods or properties.

Question Mark (?) - Used in nullable type declarations and the null-conditional operators. Also part of the conditional (ternary) operator.

Plus (+) - Used as an arithmetic operator and to concatenate strings. Also used to denote unary plus or to define overloaded operators.

Minus (`-`) - Used as an arithmetic operator, to indicate a negative number, or to define overloaded operators.

Asterisk (`*`) - Used as an arithmetic operator for multiplication, to denote pointer types, or to define overloaded operators.

Slash (/) - Used as an arithmetic operator for division. Also starts comments (// for single-line comments, /* */ for multi-line comments).

Percentage (%) - Used as the modulus operator.

Ampersand (&) - Used for the 'address-of' operator in unsafe code, logical AND, and bitwise AND. Also used in method signatures to indicate a reference parameter.

Pipe (|) - Used for logical OR and bitwise OR.

Caret (^) - Used for bitwise XOR.

Exclamation Mark (!) - Used to denote logical negation.

Tilde (~) - Used for bitwise NOT and to define destructor methods in classes.

*Angle Brackets (`

(< and >)** - Used in generic type definitions and methods, as well as for less than and greater than comparisons.

Equals (=) - Used for assignment and to test equality when paired with another equals sign (i.e., ==). Also used in lambda expressions (=>).

At Sign (@) - Used as a prefix to indicate a verbatim string literal, where escape sequences are ignored, or to use keywords as identifiers.

Dollar Sign ($) - Used to denote string interpolation, allowing variables to be embedded directly within string literals.

Backslash (\\) - Used as an escape character in string literals. For example, \\n for a new line or \\t for a tab.

Hash (#) - Used in preprocessor directives, such as #define, #if, #else, #endif, #region, and #endregion.

These characters are integral to the structure and syntax of C# code, and they are reserved for these purposes. Using them outside of their designated roles typically requires escaping or special syntax to avoid compiler errors. Understanding the specific roles of these characters helps in writing effective and error-free C# code.
